Firstly, it is too sparse, since preliminary findings showed me that a large proportion of the table has the tag `{\"created_by\": \"JOSM\"}`, which stands for Java Open Street Maps. While such information could be about houses or schools or relevant buildings, the row itself does not give me much information as it is a dictionary with a single field, along with the latitude and longitude. Hence, my code discards all such rows and the table produced is much smaller."
